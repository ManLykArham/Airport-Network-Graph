# ✈️ Airport Network Graph

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

This project simulates an airport network using a **graph data structure**, where each node represents an airport, and the edges signify direct flights between them. Users can add or remove airports, establish or delete flights, and view all airports that are either directly connected or reachable from a chosen starting airport. By implementing this graph, I explored key concepts such as **adjacency lists**, **traversal algorithms** (like breadth-first search), and graph operations, making the project a practical application of **graph theory** for managing and visualising real-world networks. 🌐

## ✨ Features

- **Add/Remove Airports**: Dynamically manage airports (nodes) in the network.
- **Add/Remove Flights**: Define and modify direct flights (edges) between airports.
- **View Connections**: Display either directly connected or reachable airports from a chosen starting point.
- **Graph Traversal**: Utilises breadth-first search to explore the network.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Add Airports**:  
   - Insert airport codes to add them as nodes in the graph.
   
2. **Add Flights**:  
   - Define connections (flights) between airports by specifying source and destination codes.

3. **Display Connections**:  
   - Display either direct or connected flights from a specified starting airport.

### 📊 Example Usage

- Add airports: `"JFK"`, `"LAX"`, and `"SFO"`.
- Connect `"JFK"` to `"LAX"` and `"LAX"` to `"SFO"`.
- Display connections starting from `"JFK"`.

**Expected Output**:  
`"LAX, SFO"`

## 🏆 Achievements

This project enhanced my understanding of **graph data structures** and their **real-world applications**. I successfully implemented adjacency lists to manage connections between airports, and applied **graph traversal techniques** to efficiently display reachable airports. The ability to add and remove nodes and edges helped reinforce my knowledge of **dynamic graph management** and the importance of efficient operations for larger datasets. 🗺️

## 🌟 Overall

Creating this **airport network** gave me practical insights into how **graph theory** can be applied to real-world problems, such as **network management** and **route optimisation**. This project not only improved my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of how data structures like graphs can be used to solve problems related to **connectivity** and **traversal** in various domains. 🚀
