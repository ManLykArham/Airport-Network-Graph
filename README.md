# Airport-Network-Graph

This project simulates an airport network using a graph data structure, where each node represents an airport and edges represent direct flights between airports. Users can add or remove airports, establish flights between them, and display all connected or directly reachable airports from a specified starting point. The project demonstrates key concepts in graph theory, including adjacency lists, traversal methods, and basic graph operations, making it a practical application of data structures for managing and visualizing networks.

## Instructions:

### Add Airports:

Insert airport codes to add them as nodes in the graph.

### Add Flights:

Define connections (flights) between airports by specifying source and destination codes.

### Display Connections:

Display either direct or connected flights from a specified starting airport.

### Example:

Add airports "JFK", "LAX", and "SFO".
Connect "JFK" to "LAX" and "LAX" to "SFO".
Display connections starting from "JFK".

### Expected output:

"LAX, SFO"
